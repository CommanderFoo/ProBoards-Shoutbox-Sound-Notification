## Shoutbox Sound Notification

Request: http://support.proboards.com/thread/660322/

Plays a sound to the user when there is a new message in the shoutbox.

Sound can be turned off at the browser level for current site or tab.

To change the sound, you will need to get your sound file and convert it to a base64 string.  There are online tools to help you do this.

There is a default sound with the plugin.
